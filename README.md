### Inspiration
In search of a clipboard manager that is comfortable and I can have instantly next to the mouse to speed up my work and at the same time I can include in my workflow and my environment based on WM's, SuperClipboard was born.

### Features
- Clean UI
- Text and Image clipboard
- Big clipboard history
- Follow cursor
- Transparent UI

> **NOTE:** The blur it's depends of your compositor

### TODO
- [ ] Fix keyboard shortcut initial parsing
- [ ] Autopaste when select from history
- [ ] Fix auto hide and show window
